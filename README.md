# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data-based projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning a new skill or technique, or just for fun.

For most projects, only a Jupyter Notebook file is included. For more complete contents some of the projects have their own, separate repositories, which are linked below.

The projects have been broadly divided into "Data Analysis Projects", "Machine Learning Projects", and "Mini-Projects" (usually just for playing around with a new bit of code, not working with a dataset).

## Data Analysis Projects
