# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data-based projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning a new skill or technique, or just for fun.

For most projects, only a Jupyter Notebook file is included. The complete contents of some projects are in separate repositories, all of which are linked to below.

The projects have been broadly divided into "Data Analysis Projects", "Machine Learning Projects", and "Mini-Projects" (usually just for playing around with a new bit of code, not working with a dataset).

### Data Analysis Projects

  * [Titanic Passanger Dataset](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Perform an analysis of the passengers onboard the Titanic, and which were the strongest factors in determining their fate. *Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib*
  * [Open Street Map - Melbourne](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/OpenStreetMap%20data%20Melbourne.ipynb): The OpenStreetMap data for Melbourne, Australia was wrangled, investigated, and cleaned. The data was relatively dirty, providing a good opportunity to practise wrangling. Here's a summary [report](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/osm_report.ipynb), and the [full repo](https://github.com/tttgm/OSM-Data-Project).*Tools: ElementTree, regex, SQLite*
  * [Wine Quality](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/wine-quality-dataset.rmd): Conducted a detailed statistical analysis of the factors influencing wine 'quality', with variables such as "acidity" and "sulphates". *Tools: R, RStudio, ggplot2, dplyr*
  * [Bay Area Bike Share](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb): Performed analysis on a dataset from a bike share company in the Bay Area. Of most interest were rider frequencies at certain times and the geographic distribution of rider traffic. *Tools: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib*
