# Data Science Portfolio
_**Tom McKenzie**_  
*Melbourne, Australia*

A collection of data-based projects completed for academic purposes, learning a new skill or technique, or just for fun.

For most projects only a Jupyter Notebook file is included. The complete contents of some projects are in separate repositories, all of which are linked to below.

The projects have been broadly divided into "Data Analysis Projects" and "Machine Learning Projects".

### Data Analysis Projects

  * [NBA Trade Tracker](https://github.com/tttgm/NBA-Trade-Tracker): Wrangled an extensive dataset of NBA player statistics to track in-season player movement via trade or aquisition. Goal is to create an interactive chord chart visualising trade 'relationships', and the effect that trades may have on player performance. Continuing project. *Tools: Numpy, pandas, plotly, d3.js*
  * [Open Street Map - Melbourne]('OpenStreetMap data Melbourne.ipynb'): The OpenStreetMap data for Melbourne, Australia was wrangled, investigated, and cleaned. The data was relatively dirty, providing a good opportunity to practise wrangling. Here's a summary [report](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/osm_report.ipynb), and the [full repo](https://github.com/tttgm/OSM-Data-Project).*Tools: ElementTree, regex, SQLite*
  * [Lyrical Analysis of Leonard Cohen Songs](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/lyric_analysis_notebook.Rmd): Performed lexical analysis of Leonard Cohen's extensive song catalogue in order to get insights into thematic changes throughout his career and predict charting success. *Tools: R, ggplot2, tidytext, NLP* 
  * [Playoff LeBron](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/PlayoffLebron%20Notebook.ipynb): A data analysis mini-project into the performance of NBA players in the regular season vs their performance in the playoffs. This was spurred from the idea of how LeBron seems to cruize through the regular season before hitting another gear in the playoffs - often catching opponents and opposing coaches off-guard! *Tools: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib*
  * [Wine Quality](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/wine-quality-dataset.rmd): Conducted a detailed statistical analysis of the factors influencing wine 'quality', with variables such as "acidity" and "sulphates". *Tools: R, ggplot2, dplyr*
  * [Bay Area Bike Share](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb): Performed analysis on a dataset from a bike share company in the Bay Area. Of most interest were rider frequencies at certain times and the geographic distribution of rider traffic. *Tools: numpy, pandas, Matplotlib*
  * [Titanic Passanger Dataset](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Performed an analysis of the passengers onboard the Titanic, and which were the strongest factors in determining their fate. *Tools: numpy, pandas, Matplotlib*

### Machine Learning Projects
**_Natural Language Processing (NLP)_**

 * [Leonard vs Bob](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/LeonardBobProj.ipynb): This is a simple application that uses a machine learning algorithm to classify a set of lyrics as being more Leonard Cohen-like or Bob Dylan-esque. The training of the algorithm included the set of lyrics from each artists extensive back-catalogue. Here's the [full repo](https://github.com/tttgm/LeonardOrBob). *Tools: NLTK, sklearn, scipy, GaussianNB*
 
**_General Machine Learning_**

 * [Enron Email Investigation](https://github.com/tttgm/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/EnronEmailInvestigation-ML.ipynb): A machine learning investigation into potential Persons Of Interest (POIs) for fraudulent behaviour eventually leading to the dramatic collapse of Enron. The dataset was a combination of email records, employee salaries, stock options, and others. *Tools: sklearn, matplotlib, PCA, KNN, SVM*
